# hide youtube recommendations chrome plugin

I really hate youtube recommendation columns, it distracts, I always know what I am looking for and what data I want to see. So, I wrote a simple plugin to hide YouTube recommendations.
It is hardcoded solution, that relies on content(it support english and russion locale for the moment) - not ideal but ok for personal usage because it took 20 min to write it :).
